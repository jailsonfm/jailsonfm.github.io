Biologist, passionate on the ocean realm and its mechanics, including the fundamental source of planetary forms of life. The link between the ecosystems and human health was later highlighted when reading an article published in the Oceanography Journal: [Overview of the Oceans and Human Health](https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/19-2_fleming.pdf). The topic ocean and human health fascinated me not only because it describes ne negative feedback as a consequence of the ocean mismanagement, but also due to the benefits of keeping the system healthy. This topic stimulated to start a master, and subsequently a PhD in Public Health and Environment, in the [National School of Public Heath (ENSP)](http://ensp.fiocruz.br/), from the Fiocruz Foundation, one of the most prestige public Health institution in Latin America. 
After finishing my PhD I started a postdoctorate position an the Leibniz centre for atropical marine reserarch, in Bremen

Early in my PhD I...
