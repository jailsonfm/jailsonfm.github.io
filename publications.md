To install Jekyll on macOS, you need a proper Ruby development environment. While macOS comes preinstalled with Ruby, we don’t recommend using that version to install Jekyll. This external article goes over the various reasons why you shouldn’t use the system Ruby.

Instead, you’ll need to install a separate and newer version of Ruby using a version manager such as asdf, chruby, rbenv, or rvm. Version managers allow you to easily install multiple versions of Ruby, and switch between them.
