<span style="color:#1277dd;">**Plastic in the ocean and its threat to the ocean, organisms and human health**</span> 

Huge amounts of plastics enter the sea.  According to a study published in the journal Science in 2015 [**(01)**](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260352), an estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enters the oceans annually, which would equivalent to dumping a garbage truck full of plastic into the ocean every minute. Linked to that information, it is estimated that there are around 5.25 trillion plastic particles floating on the ocean's surface, or approximately 399,000 tons, which is equivalent to the weight of about 4,000 blue whales [**(02)**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111913).  Furthermore, it is projected that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish by weight, if we fail to take immediate and significant action. Indeed, studies carried out from my collesgues and me show the amount of plastic at beaches is a big environmental challenge, including isolated areas far from urban areas [**(03)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969720331533?via%3Dihub). Further more our studies also show that seabirds are severely affected by ingestion of particles [**(04)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025326X17303053), but also the use to build nests [**(05)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719303672). 
This plastic waste poses an acute threat to the oceans, as many marine creatures ingest or get entangled in the plastics, often leading to fatal consequences. When the plastic decomposes, it releases toxic additives like plasticizers into the marine environment, which can also find their way into the human body through ingestion of marine organisms. Plastic peaces can act as platforms from which species can drift to new locations, adapt there and cause huge ecological damage cometing with natiuve species.


<span style="color:#1277dd;">**Cleaning the ocean: is it a possibble solution?**</span> 

Private initiatives such as the Dutch organization "Ocean Cleanup" have developed technology to rid the seas of plastic. Using 600-meter-long floating barriers, floating garbage collectors are intended to fish out plastic particles as small as one millimeter from the ocean's surface and remove them from the water. A ship transports the collected waste back to land, where it is either burned or recycled. "Ocean Cleanup" aims to clean up the "Pacific Garbage Patch" in the North Pacific, the largest garbage gyre in the oceans, within 20 years. 
[My colleagues and I from the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research, **(06)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969720346441?via%3Dihub). We analyzed the effectiveness of implementing such garbage collectors using mathematical models. We compared the expected impact of the new technology on the amount of plastic waste in the oceans within the next 130 years (from 2020 to 2150) under various scenarios, including no cleaning efforts (Business as Usual), the use of one or 200 plastic collectors, and the utilization of floating river barriers. According to our calculations, a garbage collector moving at approximately 600 meters per hour could clean a sea surface of nearly 2,700 square kilometers in a year, which corresponds to 0.00073 percent of the total surface area of the oceans.

<span style="color:#1277dd;">**A fraction of a complex and challenging problem**</span> 

The model projections revealed that without the use of any technologies, the amount of surface plastic in the oceans is estimated to triple within 40 years. However, the use of 200 garbage collectors by 2150 could potentially reduce the surface plastic accumulation by about 44,900 tons. This represents a little over five percent of the estimated global total until the end of this period, what we consider a relatively small contribution considering the increasing of plastic entering the ocean.
Also, as the garbage collectors cannot capture microplastics or plastic debris that has sunk to the ocean floor, they only influence the plastic accumulation on the water's surface.
Even if marine plastic can be successfully collected, the question remains of what happens to this plastic waste on land. So far, most discarded plastic ends up in landfills, where it takes hundreds of years to decompose, releasing toxins into soils and groundwater in the process. Recycling plastics from sea could be an alternative, although it is challenging given the diverse composition and frequent colonization by microorganisms. Sorting would require significant effort. Burning as an alternative poses ecological issues, as it could contaminate the soil or release CO2 into the atmosphere.
The garbage collectors are well-intentioned but not very effective, since our results suggest that removing plastic from the ocean has only a negligible impact, due to the sheer size of the ocean surface and the enormous quantities of plastic released into the environment. The only solution stop the production of plastics and promote alternative, more sustainable solutions such as the use of biodegradable materials. Moreover, the collection of plastic from the ocean could at some extent incentivese the production of the more plastic products and ease the societal pressure to reduce plastic use.
